# C Programming Fundamentals - Learning Project

## Learning Objectives

Hello there! Welcome to this C Programming Fundamentals learning project! In this project, I am Peter Pierre Nzioki, also known as Exoespada, and I will be exploring the fundamental concepts of C programming. By the end of this project, I aim to gain a solid understanding of the following concepts and be able to explain them without the help of Google:

### 1. Arithmetic Operators
- Understanding arithmetic operators and their use in C programming
- Performing basic mathematical operations using +, -, *, /, and %
- Exploring operator precedence and associativity

### 2. Logical Operators
- Learning about boolean operators and their significance in C
- Using logical operators such as && (AND), || (OR), and ! (NOT)
- Creating compound conditions with logical operators

### 3. Relational Operators
- Understanding relational operators and their role in C programming
- Comparing values using <, >, <=, >=, ==, and !=
- Evaluating expressions with relational operators

### 4. Boolean Values in C
- Knowing which values are considered TRUE and FALSE in C
- Understanding the concept of truthiness and falsiness in C

### 5. Conditional Statements
- Using if and if...else statements for decision-making in C
- Implementing conditional logic based on certain conditions

### 6. Comments and Code Documentation
- How to use comments to enhance code readability and understanding
- Documenting code effectively to improve maintainability

### 7. Variable Declaration and Assignment
- Declaring variables of different types (char, int, unsigned int) in C
- Assigning values to variables

### 8. Printing Variables
- Printing the values of variables of type char, int, and unsigned int using printf
- Formatting printf statements for different data types

### 9. While Loop
- Understanding the while loop and its purpose in C programming
- Using variables with the while loop for iterative operations

### 10. ASCII Character Set
- Familiarizing with the ASCII character set and its representation in C
- Working with ASCII values for character manipulation

### 11. GCC Flags -m32 and -m64
- Understanding the purpose of GCC flags -m32 and -m64
- Differentiating between 32-bit and 64-bit compilation

## Code Solutions

As I learn each concept, I will be providing code solutions to solidify my understanding. These solutions are meant for personal learning and exploration.

Please note that while the solutions are provided to guide my learning, it is essential to strive for independent problem-solving and understanding. I will take the time to analyze the code, experiment with it, and build my solutions to deepen my comprehension.

## Conclusion

I am excited to embark on this C Programming Fundamentals learning journey. With dedication and practice, I am confident that I will develop a strong foundation in C programming.

Happy coding!
