# C Programming - Static Library Learning Project: 0x09. C - Static libraries

## Learning Objectives

Hello there! Welcome to this C Programming Static Library learning project! I am Peter Pierre Nzioki, also known as Exoespada, and I will be exploring the concept of static libraries in C programming. By the end of this project, I aim to gain a solid understanding of the following learning objectives and be able to explain them without relying on external sources like Google:

### General
- What is a static library, its purpose, and how it works in C programming
- How to create a static library and package reusable code
- Understanding the basic usage of tools such as ar, ranlib, and nm for working with static libraries

## Copyright - Plagiarism

In this project, your task is to come up with solutions for the learning objectives listed above independently. Remember, copying and pasting someone else's work or publishing the content of this project is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

## Requirements

To successfully achieve the learning objectives and complete this project, please adhere to the following requirements:

### General
- You are allowed to use the editors: vi, vim, emacs for coding.
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
- Make sure that all your code files end with a new line.
- A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- Your code should follow the Betty style, which will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
- Avoid the use of global variables.
- Each file should contain no more than 5 functions.
- Do not use the standard library functions like printf, puts, etc. Instead, use _putchar for output.
- Push your header file called main.h, which should include the prototypes of all your functions, including the _putchar function.

## Note

In the provided examples, main.c files are shown for testing purposes. You can use them to test your functions, but you are not required to push them to your repository. Our main.c files might be different from the examples, and they will be used during compilation.

I am excited to embark on this Static Library learning journey in C programming. With dedication and practice, I am confident that I will develop a strong understanding of static libraries and their practical application.

Happy coding!
