# C Programming - Pointers and Strings Manipulation Learning Project: 0x07-pointers_arrays_strings

## Learning Objectives

Hello there! Welcome to this C Programming Pointers and Strings Manipulation learning project! I am Peter Pierre Nzioki, also known as Exoespada, and I will be exploring the key concepts of pointers and strings manipulation in C programming. By the end of this project, I aim to gain a solid understanding of the following concepts and be able to explain them to anyone without the help of Google:

### 1. Pointers to Pointers
- Understanding the concept of pointers to pointers and their significance in C programming
- How to use pointers to pointers for multiple levels of indirection
- Solving problems using pointers to pointers efficiently

### 2. Multidimensional Arrays
- What are multidimensional arrays and how to use them effectively
- How to declare, initialize, and access elements in multidimensional arrays
- Solving complex problems using multidimensional arrays

### 3. C Standard Library Functions for String Manipulation
- Exploring common C standard library functions for manipulating strings
- How to implement string operations without using the standard library
- Understanding the importance of string manipulation functions in C programming

## Copyright - Plagiarism

You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet the above learning objectives. Remember, copying and pasting someone else's work or publishing the content of this project is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

## Requirements

To successfully achieve the learning objectives and complete this project, please ensure the following requirements are met:

### General
- You are allowed to use the editors: vi, vim, emacs for coding.
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
- Make sure that all your code files end with a new line.
- A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- Your code should follow the Betty style, which will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
- Avoid the use of global variables.
- Each file should contain no more than 5 functions.
- Do not use the standard library functions like printf, puts, etc. Instead, use _putchar for output.
- Push your header file called main.h, which should include the prototypes of all your functions, including the _putchar function.

## Note

In the provided examples, main.c files are shown for testing purposes. You can use them to test your functions, but you are not required to push them to your repository. Our main.c files might be different from the examples, and they will be used during compilation.

I am excited to embark on this Pointers and Strings Manipulation learning journey in C programming. With dedication and practice, I am confident that I will develop a strong foundation in these essential concepts.

Happy coding!
