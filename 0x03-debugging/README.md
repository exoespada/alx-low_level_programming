# Debugging in C - Learning Project

## Learning Objectives

Hello there! Welcome to this Debugging in C learning project! In this project, I am Peter Pierre Nzioki, also known as Exoespada, and my objective is to explore the art of debugging in C programming. By the end of this project, I aim to gain a solid understanding of the following concepts and be able to explain them to anyone without the help of Google:

### 1. What is Debugging?
- Understanding the importance of debugging in the software development process
- Defining the concept of debugging and its role in identifying and fixing errors

### 2. Methods of Debugging Manually
- Learning various methods for manually debugging C programs
- Using print statements for debugging and identifying problematic code sections
- Employing step-by-step execution to analyze program flow

### 3. Reading Error Messages
- How to interpret and understand error messages generated by the compiler or runtime
- Analyzing error messages to identify the root cause of issues
- Utilizing error messages as a tool for effective debugging

## Code Solutions

As I learn each debugging method, I will be applying them to real-world code examples to solidify my understanding. These solutions are meant for personal learning and exploration.

Please note that while the solutions are provided to guide my learning, it is essential to strive for independent problem-solving and understanding. I will take the time to analyze the code, experiment with debugging techniques, and refine my skills to become a proficient debugger.

## Conclusion

I am enthusiastic about diving into the world of debugging in C. With dedication and practice, I am confident that I will sharpen my debugging skills and become adept at resolving programming errors efficiently.

Happy coding!
