# ALX Software Engineering Course - C Programming

Welcome to the ALX Software Engineering Course repository for C programming! This repository contains code written by Peter Pierre Nzioki, also known as exoespada, a dedicated student of the ALX Software Engineering Course. Here, you will find code examples and projects that cover a range of learning objectives related to C programming.

## Learning Objectives
By exploring the code in this repository, you will be able to grasp the following concepts and answer these questions without the need for external references:

- Understand why C programming is considered awesome.
- Learn about the inventors of the C programming language, including Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan, and Linus Torvalds.
- Gain knowledge about the compilation process and what happens when you type `gcc main.c`.
- Explore the significance of the entry point and the role of the `main` function.
- Discover different methods to print text, including the usage of `printf`, `puts`, and `putchar`.
- Understand how to determine the size of a specific type using the unary operator `sizeof`.
- Learn how to compile C code using `gcc`.
- Familiarize yourself with the default program name when compiling with `gcc`.
- Explore the official C coding style and how to check your code using `betty-style`.
- Understand the process of finding the appropriate header to include in your source code when using standard library functions.
- Discover how the `main` function influences the return value of the program.
